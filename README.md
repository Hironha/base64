## Base64 Encoding

Base64 encoding is a way to encode binary data as an ASCII string. It is used to encode data that is not ASCII text, such as binary data, and to encode text that contains characters that are not allowed in a URL, such as spaces. This is a simple implementation that does not aim to be full compatible with the standard [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648).
